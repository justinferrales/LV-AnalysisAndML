# Launch Vehicle Analysis and Machine Learning (Data 301 - Intro to Data Science)
In this project, I parsed nextspaceflight.com for information about various rockets detailing their successes and failures as well as the amount of launches that they had. Additionally, I used a dataset (.csv) shown above from Kaggle to do machine learning to predict the success of a launch on various factors. The main machine learning algorithm used was KNN classification, which utilized the aforementioned factors and columns given above. This project gave me experience in parsing websites for data, cleaning dataframes, and using sci-kit learn. The sci-kit library was used for machine learning namely, one hot encoder for manipulating qualitative data to make predictions on non numerical data. Final results can be found on CodeWithPlots.pdf and for the source code it can be found on LV_ML_code.pdf. A presentation detailing a brief overview of what was done can also be found on Launch Vehicle Analysis and Machine Learning.pdf, all of which can be found listed on my repo.
